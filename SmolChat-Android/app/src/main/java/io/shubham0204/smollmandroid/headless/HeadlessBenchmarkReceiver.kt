/**
 * Receives `com.smollmandroid.RUN_PROMPT` broadcasts (e.g. from ADB) and delegates to
 * [HeadlessBenchmarkService] which runs inference in a foreground service so the process
 * is not killed mid-run.
 *
 * Required extras:
 *   model_path — absolute path to a .gguf file on device
 *   prompt     — text to send for inference
 *   run_id     — unique string used to correlate log lines
 *
 * Example ADB command:
 *   adb shell am broadcast -a com.smollmandroid.RUN_PROMPT \
 *     -n io.shubham0204.smollmandroid/.headless.HeadlessBenchmarkReceiver \
 *     --es model_path /sdcard/Download/model-q4_k_m.gguf \
 *     --es prompt "What is the capital of France?" \
 *     --es run_id run_001
